# AICPrime blockchain

## AICP company

The parent community of AICPrime, “AICPrime Technologies” was founded in August 2017 as a Research and Development group with a particular focus on artificial intelligence technology. AICPrime assisted the establishment and maintenance of many artificial intelligence algorithms throughout Europe and Asia. AICPrime has managed to earn $2.1 million dollars by designing and building artificial intelligence algorithms and related technologies since 2017.

## What is a blockchain?

Blockchain is a type of information recording and reporting system. The difference between blockchain and other systems is that the information stored on this type of system is shared among all members of a network. By using encryption and data distribution, the possibility of hacking, deleting and manipulating recorded information is almost eliminated. This is the simplest possible explanation about blockchain that can be given.

## Why This May be Interesting

Almost all blockchains in the market can be defined in this way. If there is a need to update the blockchain, they should use a fork according to the type of update, and each blockchain works according to a specific algorithm. AI by itself is designed based on human patterns and has many limitations. To design and develop the AI blockchain, the limitations of the human model must be removed first. To solve this problem, we have taken a big step and introduced ruleless algorithms along with the AICP framework. With the AICP framework standards and ruleless algorithms, we have taken the biggest step towards the first ruleless artificial intelligence blockchain, so that we can go towards the design of a blockchain that does not have model restrictions like all the blockchains presented.
